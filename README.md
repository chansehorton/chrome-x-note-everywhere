# Notes Everywhere

###General Idea 
A very simple note taking chrome extension that will give the user a note on each unique webpage, and store the contents of that note, so that it can be accessed on return visits. Initial storage will be to localstorage, with the intent to move to database storage, so that the notes will be accessible via Google account login.
